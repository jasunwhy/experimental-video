Optimized GL-RRT Based Exploration for Indoor Mobile Robots Using Adaptive K-Means++ Clustering: Experimental.

Introduction:
  This repository provides the relevant experimental videos of the experimental data in the paper, which you can download and watch directly

Introduction to branch:
   1. Experimental video in simulation environment:
     simulation-environment-1/2-experiment-video-of-RRT+non-clustering.
     simulation-environment-1/2-experiment-video-of-RRT+K-Means.
     simulation-environment-1/2-experiment-video-of-RRT+Means-shift.
     simulation-environment-1/2-experiment-video-of-our-method.
   These several documents detail the exploration time, total trajectory length, and map coverage of different algorithms in the simulation environment.
   2. Experimental videos in a real environment:
     Experimental-video-of-RRT+non-clustering-in-real-environment.
     Experimental-video-of-RRT+K-Means-in-real-environment.
     Experimental-video-of-RRT+Mean-shift-in-real-environment.
     Experimental-video-of-our-methods-in-real-environment.
   These several documents detail the exploration time, the total length of the trajectory, the map coverage of the different algorithms in the office environment.
   3. Frontier-point-benefit-experiment
   The document details the comparison before and after optimization of the frontier point revenue experiment.
